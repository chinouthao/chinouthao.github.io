The Collegeville Project is focused on exploring new research topics in computational science and engineering (CSE) while at the same time exploring new research methodologies as part of scope.  I am the project lead primarily in my role as Scientist in Residence at St. John's University, MN.  Most of the research is conducted by undergraduate computer science, mathematics and, recently, psychology students.
