The Mantevo Project an effort to create mini-applications that enable full-spectrum design space exploration.  Mini-apps are working code that embody performance impacting elements of large apps, and can be adapted to match new platforms. I started the Mantevo project in 2007.  Mantevo was a 2014 R&D 100 Award winner.
