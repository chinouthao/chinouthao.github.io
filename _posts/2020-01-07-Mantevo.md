I started the Mantevo project, an effort to create mini-applications that enable full-spectrum design space exploration.  Mini-apps are working code that embody performance impacting elements of large apps, and can be adapted to match new platforms. GitHub: [https://github.com/mantevo](https://github.com/mantevo).
